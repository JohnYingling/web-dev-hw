<h5><b>DIRTY FINGERS</b></h5>
<p> Dirty Fingers are a so called "spazz punk" band from Shanghai.
  They yelp and wail and break stuff, and don't really care what anyone thinks.
  If you're looking for some seriously solid new tunes, this is your best bet.
  Shanghai is, in the grand scheme, a much smaller city for rock than Beijing,
  so you're best bet at the moment is this new startup of crazy folks!
  <br /> See 'em!' <br />

<h6><b>HIPERSON (海朋森) from Chengdu, Sichuan</b></h6>
<p> I first caught Hiperson back in 2014, when I was on tour with P.K.14.
  They absolutely blew my mind, were super nice to me, and opened my eyes to
  Sichuan province like I never expected. We've become good friends, stayed in
  contact, and now, they're poised to take over not only Sichuna province, but
  China, and beyond! They toured Europe, and it was a success, so I can only
  see better and more broad things happening, as their sound shifts. They also
  played Beijing recently, and scrapped their entire old set for new material!
  <br /> Now THAT'S a bold move, my friends. <br /></p>

<p> These are you best bets for digging it. Sure, my own website is at the top
  of the list, but I honestly think in 10 years, I'll look back on it all and
  really be happy I am such a nerd with this all. I do plan on starting a short
  film series to go alongside the longer films, because they take so long.</p>
<br />Dive into the wormhole, my friends. It all starts here.<br />
