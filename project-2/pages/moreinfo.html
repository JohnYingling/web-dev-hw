<h2>P.K.14 : Live in Chengdu</h2>
<p>When I met Hiperson on that previously mentioned trip, I filmed P.K.14's set.
It was a wild, intense time for me, as my laptop had died earlier that day.
I had no idea what was in store for me from that point on, but I rode this wave.
After that day, I'd say my life was changed. So began years of involvement in
China, and a long, deep wormhole of new sounds.</p>
<h2> DIDERS : Live at Yugong Yishan </h2>

Speaking of "spazz punk", the Diders are still around, but not the same.
Poppy is gone to America to go to school, and Francis is a swing dancer.
Funny how quickly things can change.
<h3> AFTER ARGUMENT: Live in Guangzhou </h3>

AFTER ARGUMENT, Yang Haisong from P.K.14's baby project, is also now dead.
Not only that, but this venue no longer exists in South China.
Things are changing at a rapid pace.
This is why I do what I do.
