Made the thing.

No huge blowups, yet.

Fairly easy, but...

Unsure is good.

...had a red dot, killed it.  Go Yingling!

<b>(still unsure if good)</b>

Wow... okay.  this one was harsh.

First off, I could not connect images.

I literally tried for 5 hours to fix it on my own.

Put an issue request.  Not much help, but appreciated anyway.

Finally, I caved and e-mail the teacher.

It was a simple change for .jpg to ".JPG!!!!"

...oof.  I feel...used.

Nontheless, it is finished, and forms / buttons were all fairly without explosion.

Gonna go cry in a corner now.  Thanks, HTML.

(i think i remember why i stopped doing this 10 years ago...)
