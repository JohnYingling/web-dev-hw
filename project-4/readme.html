<h1>RESPONSIVE WEB DE-BLERGH!</h1>

Readme :

What is responsive web design and why is it important?

Responsive web design is a backbone of the internet.  I think if there are students in this class that are older than 22, or even if they're not, they've come across the terrors poor responsiveness can bring to the realm of the internet.  It breaks you, literally, as you cannot continue sometimes.  RSW fixes a mobile, on the go generation to load up anything they want at any time, and have it readily and easily readable.

What is the information this page aims to deliver?
It's a short summary of RSW.
What is the first information on the page that should draw the eye?
The first thing would be the title of Responsive Web Design (or the meme!)
What is the primary content of this page?
To let people know of the dangers of lack of RSW!
What is the secondary content?
Dank memes.

I had a really hard time with this last project.  I spent so much time on this class, and often forgot things I did the week before, leading to a hellish nightmare of back-tracking that almost totally broke me, and led to me being behind in all of my other courses.
I just don't understand why this was so difficult for me, but it was.
I think I did well, in the end, considering I did not give up, and got all the things to connect!
Hell of a ride.  Now I remember why I stopped doing this 20 years ago!!!!!
