    <h1>Responsive Web Design</h1>
    <p>So here we are, <i>Responsive Web Design!</i> This is a crucial set of
    tools for people to make our lives on the web easier.  Not only can one read
  easier, but it helps you keep people on your site longer!  Attentions spans
  are lowering, and we must do what we can to retain our viewers! <area shape="default" coords="" href="#" alt=""> </p>
    <h2>It's up to us to make a cleaner, better internet!</h2>
    <h3>Furthermore....</h3>
    Responsive web design is a backbone of the internet.  I think if there are students in this class that are older than 22, or even if they're not, they've come across the terrors poor responsiveness can bring to the realm of the internet.
    <h4>It'll ruin your day!</h4>
    It breaks you, literally, as you cannot continue sometimes.  RSW fixes a mobile, on the go generation to load up anything they want at any time, and have it readily and easily readable.
    <p>...and that starts with <b>YOU!</b> </p>
