      <h1> Squirrel Song</h1>
      <h2> by Shellac </h2>
      This is a sad f*cking song...
We'll be lucky if I don't bust out crying

How does it feel?
Your night light, your curling iron
Lit up by the sweat of others
For many's the day
But not from November to May

The floor is littered
With woodchips and apple cores
And hulls of acorns
There is a chattering sound

Because they were squirrels; real squirrels
(And there were thousands)
This isn't some kind of metaphor
Goddamn, this is real
