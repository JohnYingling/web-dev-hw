    <h1>About Margaret Wise Brown</h1>
    <p><i>Margaret Wise Brown</i> wrote many children's book, but
    apparently she also secretly hated children, which I found out
    doing this website, and now am subsequently totally sad about.</p>
    <h2>She died 3908213908</h2>
    <p>Excuse me while I weep for my childhood.</p>
