<h1>Goodnight Moon</h1>

<h5>This was a staple of my childhood, so I'd like to either
introduce it to people, or have those who loved it as well, remember it.</h5>

<h5>I want to choose the green and orange colors from the book!</h5>

<h5>Since the book itself is simple, I'd like simplicity to shine, but keep
good, solid text and design choices to make it pop.<h5>
